Snippets Scheme.org Microdata 0.7.8
====================
A PHP Snippets for the standard theme that integrates Schema.org microdata directly into wiki, blog and podcasts pages.

The default Snippets theme for Yellow Blog is beautiful and functional. I wanted to make it even more functional by including added microdata in the theme by default. Google, along with several other large companies like Bing and Yahoo, introduced Schema.org, a collection of microdata formats that can be used as a common machine language to identify bits and pieces of web pages. This theme incorporates that language and embeds it directly into your site. Read more about in

Acording Google Docs for Webmasters, adding microdata to your site has several benefits. First and foremost, you contribute to machine readable data everywhere. The Internet is a wonderful place for humans to browse, but we can make it more accessible and more consumable if we let the computer figure as much of it out as it can. Second, search engines can use this data to get a better understanding of each page that it indexes, and hopefully provide more relevant search results.  Test your blog in Google tools https://search.google.com/structured-data/testing-tool/u/0/

Additionally, I have added HTML5 codes into Snippets, since that functionality existed was very useful.
